    <p>Fresh pasta isn't something to master in one go. It takes time and practice, but it yields dividends. This
        particular recipe is vastly versatile. It can be made into whole grain pasta, by swapping in 1 cup sifted whole
        wheat, spelt or farro flour in place of 1 cup all-purpose or 00 flour. Add more egg yolks or water as needed and
        rest the dough for 1 hour. Or try a green pasta, as in this ravioli verdi: Steam or sauté 6 ounces baby spinach
        (about 6 cups) until just wilted. Spread it out on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and, when cool, squeeze water
        out thoroughly, a handful at a time, then chop roughly. Purée with 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk, then use this mixture
        in place of eggs in the recipe. Or, for something a little different, make an herbed pasta, like this
        pappardelle, by stirring in ½ cup finely chopped parsley, chives, chervil, tarragon, or basil in any combination
        to the eggs before adding to the flour in the main recipe.
